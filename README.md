# JIRA-PowerBi-Integration-Using-Python
 
Python script pulls data by using JIRA API calls and stores them directly in the power bi data sources. This project will take three inputs from the user: Jira user name, Password and the jql query.
Then power bi will login to JIRA using the userid/password and execute the JQL query and fetch the output of the query into a power bi datasource.
